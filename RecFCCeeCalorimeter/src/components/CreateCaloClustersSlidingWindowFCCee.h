/** @class CreateCaloClustersSlidingWindowFCCee
 *
 *  Algorithm for creating calorimeter clusters from cells.
 *
 *  Reconstruction is performed for the calorimeter with readout '\b readoutName' and volume ID retrieved using '\b
 *fieldNames' and '\b fieldValues'.
 *
 *  Sliding window algorithm:
 *  1. Create calorimeter towers.
 *     A tower contains all cells within certain theta and phi (tower size: '\b deltaThetaTower', '\b deltaPhiTower').
 *     Currently there is no support of cell splitting, so each cell should be completely inside the tower
 *  2. Find local maxima.
 *     Local maxima are found using the sliding window of a fixed size in phi x theta ('\b nThetaWindow' '\b nPhiWindow' in
 *units of tower size).
 *     If a local max is found and its energy is above threshold ('\b energyThreshold'), it is added to the preclusters
 *list.
 *     Each precluster contains the barycentre position and the transverse energy.
 *     Position is recalculated using the window size in theta x phi ('\b nThetaPosition', '\b nPhiPosition')
 *     that may be smaller than the sliding window to reduce the noise influence. Both windows are centred at the same
 *tower. The energy of the precluster is the energy calculated using the sliding window.
 *  3. Remove duplicates.
 *     If two pre-clusters are found next to each other (within window '\b nThetaDuplicates', '\b nPhiDuplicates'), the
 *pre-cluster with lower energy is removed.
 *     Currently there is no support on energy sharing between clusters, so if duplicate window is smaller than
 *sliding window, some towers may be taken twice (instead of the weighted energy).
 *  4. Build clusters.
 *     Clusters are created using the window of a fixed size in phi x theta ('\b nThetaFinal' '\b nPhiFinal' in units of
 *tower size) around the barycentre position.
 *     For each cluster the cell collection is searched and all those inside the cluster are attached.
 *
 *  Note: Sliding window performs well for electrons/gamma reconstruction. Topological clusters should be better for jets.
